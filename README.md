## Torus Knot Geo!

**GLITCH LINK**

This application is a Torus Knot simulator where we can edit its geometry. It makes use of Three.js for the shape geometry and rendering of the shape. It also makes use of Tweakpane for the controls of the simulator wich are connected to the parameters of the shape generated it shape. Besides controling the shapes geometry with the twekpane panel you can also change the colore of the shape and the speed in wich it rotates in both axes. 

- The goal of this application is to be able to simulate the geometry of a Torus Knot while giving liberty to the user to change ite parameters. So that they may create creative shapes.
- The biggest challenge faced was getting Tweakpane panel to display the sliders how I wanted and then updated the paramaters from the torus know geometry got from three.js.
